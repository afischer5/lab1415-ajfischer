# Q1
    Cloesest first appears to operate the same as breadth first search.
    Depthfirst appears to be different from these two however this is most likely due the
    selection differences of equally weighted vertecies in the two algorithims. random walk is very different
    in that it chooses a random connected point to go to and will revisit points.
    The only major difference among starting points is the first point due to the shallow
    nature of this graph.
    
# Q2
    A read world map may require more than four colors if countries are not contiguous ie angola.
    or in the event of a non planar 3d map where the dimenalitiy of possible edges is very different.
